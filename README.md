This repository holds the code for my tutorial series on __*Building a text editor with PyQt*__, where I outline the process of creating a rich-text editor using the Python binding for Qt, PyQt. The editor includes features for:

+ File management
+ Rich-text formatting
+ Table insertion and management
+ Find-and-replace
+ Inserting images
+ And more!
